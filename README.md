# DeepLearning
by [Sho Nakagome](https://github.com/shonaka)

A repository for practicing deep learning implementation using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and other equivalent deep learning libralies.

There are ipython notebook implementation and python code implementation (tensorboard). Usually jupyter notebook is just to show what kinds of analysis I performed and the python code implementation is more for practical usage with some other visualizations using tensorboard.

### Jupyter notebook implementation

* [TF01 - Linear model](https://github.com/shonaka/TF_practice/blob/master/TF01_linear_model.ipynb)

* [TF02 - Simple CNN](https://github.com/shonaka/TF_practice/blob/master/TF02_CNN.ipynb)

* [TF03 - Simple RNN](https://github.com/shonaka/DeepLearning/blob/master/TF03_RNN.ipynb)

### Python code implementation with tensorboard

Please check inside the folder named "python_codes" in this repository. These codes are similar to the jupyter notebook implementation above, but are more practical and nicely organized codes with a little more features added (e.g. tensorboard).

You can see the ["README.md"](https://github.com/shonaka/TF_practice/tree/master/python_codes) inside the folder to see what kinds of tensorboard visualization you can see after running the code.

### Environment
* Windows 10, Python 3.6, tensorflow-gpu 1.4.0 and 1.5.0
* Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.6, tensorflow-gpu 1.4.0 and 1.5.0
* GPU: GTX1070

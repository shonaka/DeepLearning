# TF_practice
by Sho Nakagome

A repository for practicing deep learning implementation using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

There are ipython notebook implementation and python code implementation (tensorboard).

### Jupyter notebook implementation

* [TF01 - Linear model](https://github.com/shonaka/TF_practice/blob/master/TF01_linear_model.ipynb)

* [TF02 - Simple CNN](https://github.com/shonaka/TF_practice/blob/master/TF02_CNN.ipynb)


### Python code implementation with tensorboard

Please check inside the folder named "python_codes" in this repository.

You can see the ["README.md"](https://github.com/shonaka/TF_practice/tree/master/python_codes) inside the folder to see what kinds of tensorboard visualization you can see after running the code.
